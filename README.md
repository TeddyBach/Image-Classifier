# Image-Classifier

In this project, we worked on and presented our final project. The task was to use the CIFAR-10 dataset with 10 classes, and create a model to classify multiple thousands of images under one of these classes. We also experimented with a couple of different optimizer, such as Adam and RMSprop, and found the latter to be more efficient. Overall, with augmentation, a batch size of 64, and 10 epochs, we achieved a loss of .202, and an accuracy of 79%.
